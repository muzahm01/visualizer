# Visualizer

Visualizer is a Streamlit app for interactively visualizing JSON and CSV files.

It supports uploading two files, selecting common tables (for JSON) or columns (for CSV), choosing X‑axis and up to 2 Y‑axes, and customizing graph options (Line, Bar, or Pie) via a three‑column UI layout.
